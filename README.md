# MACHINE_LEARNING_C
This project is part of a TP that was given to us in our university to realize a CNN in the C language in one week. The code contained in this repository is the result of our work,to make it we were inspired by the modeling of the python code contained in this repository https://github.com/TheIndependentCode/Neural-Network  
Regarding the data structures we used the Array struture developed by a friend and me here is the link of the repository 
https://github.com/MbeHenri/arrayc
with the Array library we aim to develop the equivalent of numpy in C language all your contributions are expected we still have problems of modeling. For those who want to join us here is our email: 
dimitri.tchaheu@facsciences-uy1.cm 
henri.mbe@facsciences-uy1.cm  
We would also like to set up a dependency manager for C.
Regarding the implementation of the CNN we had to implement almost all layers except the pooling layer because of the time constraints. In this implementation there is still a lot of memory leakage. For the training of our model we used a dataset on anomaly detection although it is not adapted for the CNN. We intend to improve this program and your contributions are also expected
